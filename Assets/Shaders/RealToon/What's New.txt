What's New to RealToon V5.0.8p3 (Patch#3) (October 2021)
=====================================
[New]
- Main Color Power (URP and HDRP)
  * This will let you adjust the intensity of the Main Color.
  * You don't need to adjust the Main Color to darker color or gray color to prevent overexposure, just adjust this new option.

- Compute Deformation [DOTS - Hybrid Renderer] (Currently URP 10, 12 and later)

- Light Ignore Y Normal Direction (Self Shadow) (URP and HDRP)
  * Light will ignore object's Y normal direction when the angle or position of the light is in X or Z.
  * Self Shadow/Shade will move in X or Z only.

[Fix]
- Transparent mode "Affect Shadow" does not work properly.
- Include "Sobel Outline Effect" again, this was missing or not included in packing the shader. (Built-In) (Unity 2019 to Later)

[Change]
- "Use Vertex Color As Normal" has been removed. (URP and HDRP)
- "Main Color" default color has been changed to white because of the new option "Main Color Power". (URP and HDRP)

[Improved]
- "Shadow Color" and "Shadow Color Texture" has been improved, the colors are now accurate and you'll get what you select. (When Light Affect Shadow is disabled) (HDRP)



Note/Warning (If you are already a RealToon (URP or HDRP) user and planned to update your project to this patch):
  *There is a new option for "Main Color" to adjust the intensity and it is set to low value to prevent overexposure,
  if you still want to use the previous "Main Color" intesnity, just set the "Main Color Power" to 1.

  *"Shadow Color" and "Shadow Color Texture" has been improved on RealToon HDRP, you might need to re-adjust the shadow color or the "Overall Shadow Color Power"
